# REPL

The worst REPL you've ever seen.

REPL provides a simple way to bind textual commands to python functions. If
you need an interactive, shell-like interface, this might sort of work.

Features:

* Command [Arguments...]
* $Variables
* Subshell expansion
* Persistent variables
* Sourcing / scripting support
* Startup state
* Configurable dotfile name for startup
* Dotfile overrides
* A reasonable [empty] basis
* Reasonable builtins
* Some kind of help system
* Backslash escapes
* Quoting
* Aliases and backslash escapes

Stretch Goals:

* Flow control: Loops
* Flow control: Conditional statements
* Flow control: Functions (Ooh, shiny...)
* Useful prompt variables
* Parameter expansion
* Redirects and pipes
